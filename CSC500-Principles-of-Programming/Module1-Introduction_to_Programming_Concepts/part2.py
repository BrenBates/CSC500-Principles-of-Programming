# Part 2:
# Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.

# Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, multiply them together to find the output. Also, divide num1/num2 to find the output.

# Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the code from parts 1 and 2, the results and GIT repository in a single document (Word is preferred).

num1 = int(input("Enter a number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter another number:"))


print(num1,'*',num2,'is',num1*num2)
print(num1,'/',num2,'is',num1/num2)
